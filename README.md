photoshop-layer-search-plugin
=============================

It is very hard to find a specific layer in photoshop. Photoshop doesn't support searching of layers. This plugin 
helps you to do so. 

Quickly search through your photoshop layers. Focus by click.

Requirements
============
I have tested it only in Adobe PS5, Mac.
